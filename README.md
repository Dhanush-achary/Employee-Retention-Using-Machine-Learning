Predicting Employee Retention Using Machine Learning Models
Project Summary

Objective: Developed a machine learning solution to predict employee churn, leveraging Gradient Boosting Classifier, XGBoost Classifier, and Random Forest models.
Key Results:
  Random Forest: Achieved the highest accuracy of 81%, outperforming the other models. Precision and recall metrics were balanced for both classes, with class 0 precision at 0.78 and recall at 0.61, and class 1 precision at 0.83 and recall at 0.91.
  XGBoost Classifier: Provided an accuracy of 79%, demonstrating good performance with precision and recall values of 0.72 and 0.59 for class 0, and 0.81 and 0.89 for class 1.
  Gradient Boosting Classifier: Reached an accuracy of 78%, with room for improvement in classifying class 0 instances.
Actionable Insights & Recommendations:
  Grade & Joining Designation: High correlation (0.71) suggests the need for career progression paths and training programs to enhance retention.
  Income & Grade: With a correlation of 0.74, revising the compensation structure based on performance and tenure is crucial.
  Quarterly Rating: Employees with increased quarterly ratings are less likely to churn; strategies for regular feedback and recognition are recommended.
  Monthly Salary Increase: Salary stagnation correlates with higher churn; regular salary reviews are advised.
  Machine Learning Model Insights: Random Forestâ€™s superior performance indicates its potential for proactive churn management; further optimization and HR integration are recommended.
